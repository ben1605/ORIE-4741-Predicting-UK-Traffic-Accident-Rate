We would like to estimate UK?s traffic accident rate, and found the datasets from UK?s Department for Transport. There are two datasets. One records each of the traffic accidents happened in UK with details, while the other one contains the traffic flow in over ten regions in UK. Both of the two datasets have records from 2000 to 2015, with the exception that there is a loss of traffic accidents data happened in 2008. We would like to find which factors influence the accident rate.
